Hey! Iâ€™m Perry, a data scientist and engineer with 6+ years experience leading data science initiatives in early stage tech companies. I love working with great people to leverage data, machine learning and software to solve meaningful problems. I have experience building data pipelines, machine learning models, web applications, and working with APIs, working mostly in Python. In my free time you can find me in the backcountry hiking, climbing or exploring startup ideas with friends.

My tech stack includes: Python, Machine Learning Libraries (NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Turi Create, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, fastai, Transformers), Web Application Frameworks (Flask, FastAPI), AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, Batch, Lambda, SageMaker), Google Cloud Platform, Heroku, Bash, Git, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, APIs, Geographic Information Systems and some basic JavaScript, HTML, CSS stuff
