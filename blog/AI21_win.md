# AI21 Labs Hackathon

## <span> What is AI21 Labs </span>
[AI21 Labs](https://www.ai21.com/about) constructs cutting-edge language models that have demonstrated superior performance relative to other services, as verified by [HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/?).

Their language models, available as a service, can be utilized for various natural language processing (NLP) assignments.
